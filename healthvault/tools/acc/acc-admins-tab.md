# Admins Tab

The Admins tab in the Application Configuration Center allows an existing application administrator to manage other administrators of the application. An administrator can send or resend an invitation to someone to become an application manager. 

HealthVault requires that each app has at least one application manager. An administrator can remove the authorization as well.
